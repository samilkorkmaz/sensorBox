Server side code to display sensor data as time plots. To see plots, navigate to https://samilkorkmaz.com.

Sensor data (temperature, humidity, pressure) is sent via websockets [socket.io](https://socket.io/)

For ESP32 code that collects data from sensor and sends it to this server code, see [ESP32_DHT22.ino](https://gist.github.com/samilkorkmaz/779ae74e0a3c7c5170625320f60a6a7f)
